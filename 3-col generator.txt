I want to create an interface on my website with a field to enter number x and a button to trigger the execution of a python script on the backend. The construction of the graph begins using the smaller EHI graphs proposed by Mizunu and Nishihara. As soon at the number of the vertices of the evolving graph surpassed the value x the generation is terminated. A link to download the constructed graph is then shown on the webpage as the output.
